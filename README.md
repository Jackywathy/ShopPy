# ShopPy
A little basic gui written in python that is able to write to and read from a sqlite database. Not really complete, but works well enough kinda :D

# Running
- clone the repo using:    "git clone https://github.com/Jackywathy/ShopPy"
- navigate to directory:   "cd ShopPy"
- run the python:          "python(3) main.py"
- a gui *should* pop up 

## Functionality
- Can query (display isbn, book number etc) 
- Can do stock (a little glitchy but somewhat works)

## TODO
- finish insert
- make stock more intuitive
- make a checkout mode
